        massage=" &nbsp; &nbsp; It was nice to spend time in Ukraine. Although waking up to explosions is not very pleasant. 
        October 10, 2022. That day, we saw with our own eyes the destroyed playgrounds near one of the Kyiv universities, crushed 
        cars, broken roads and the loss of lives in the middle of Kyiv. Russia bombed Ukraine with more than 80 missiles that day 
        and continues to do so every day. We, like most of Kyivans, spent that day in a bomb shelter, where there were many outsiders. 
        In our bomb shelter, everyone who was there was treated to coffee and goodies absolutely free of charge, and outside everything
         was closed and rockets were flying. When everything was over, we visited the places where the rockets fell and it was terrifying...."

          &nbsp; &nbsp;The main targets are civilians and critical
          infrastructure that ensures ordinary people are left without heat and
          electricity. We started buying firewood for people who cannot afford
          it and would be cold in winter if not for generous people. In addition
          to purchasing, our team helps to fully prepare them for use by people
          who are unable to do it themselves. <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; As most
          Ukrainians say, time seems to have stopped, and winter is still here -
          February 24. Hundreds of days of heroism, hundreds of days of bombing,
          hundreds of days of people's deaths. But, like everything else, we get
          used to it. We get used to reading the news and hearing stories of
          tragedy, heroism and bravery. However, the war is not over! We can be
          exhausted and think that allies will provide all the needs, but that
          is simply not possible. Prices in Ukraine have risen sharply since the
          start of the war, and many ordinary people are struggling to make ends
          meet. They need our help - ordinary people living in peace. <br />{" "}
